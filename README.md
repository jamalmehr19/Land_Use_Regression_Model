# Land_Use_Regression_Model
This dataset is based on annual average NO2 concentrations (measured across 26 European countries in 2010. After collating the measurements, the study team added a range of potentially predictive independent variables reflecting land use, traffic, geography, and known NO2 emissions. Some of the variables have been modified for the purposes of this project.
