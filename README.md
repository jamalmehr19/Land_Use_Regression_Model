This dataset is based on annual average NO2 concentrations (measured across 26 European countries in 2010). After collating the measurements, the study team added a range of potentially predictive independent variables reflecting land use, traffic, geography, and known NO2 emissions. Some of the variables have been modified for the purposes of this project.
The data is achieved from this website: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749117348674
